/**
 * Initialization order for Godot (see [Godot main](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/main/main.cpp)).
 * - Main::setup()
 * - register_core_types()
 * - register_early_core_singletons()
 * - initialize_extensions(GDExtension::INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_CORE)
 * - Main::setup2()
 * - register_server_types()
 * - initialize_extensions(GDExtension::INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_SERVERS)
 * - register_core_singletons() ...possibly a bug. Should this be before LEVEL_SERVERS?
 * - register_scene_types()
 * - register_scene_singletons()
 * - initialize_extensions(GDExtension::INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_SCENE)
 * - IF EDITOR
 * - register_editor_types()
 * - initialize_extensions(GDExtension::INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_EDITOR)
 * - register_server_singletons() ...another weird one.
 * - Autoloads, etc.
 *
 * ## Singleton availability by initialization level
 * - **Core level**: Basic singletons like `Engine`, `OS`, `ProjectSettings`, `Time` are available.
 * - **Servers level**: Server singletons like `RenderingServer` are NOT yet available due to GDExtension timing issues.
 * - **Scene level**: All singletons including `RenderingServer` are available.
 * - **Editor level**: Editor-specific functionality is available.
 *
 * GDExtension singletons are generally not available during *any* level initialization, except a few core singletons
 * (see above). This is different from how modules work, where servers are available at _Servers_ level.
 *
 * See also:
 * - [Singletons not accessible in Scene (godot-cpp)](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp/issues/1180)
 * - [`global_get_singleton` not returning singletons](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/64975)
 * - [PR to make singletons available](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98862)
